Slab-wise Pricing Implementation Logic
=======================================

Overview
--------
The pricing logic has been centralized in `src/utils/pricing.ts` to ensure consistency across the application. 
The logic is driven by the "IBR + Markup %" model, where the markup percentage varies based on the Slab (Foreign Currency Amount) and the Product Type.

1. Slab Definition
------------------
The slabs are defined based on the Foreign Currency (FCY) Amount.
(Assuming the units 0-50, 51-100, etc. refer to Thousands of base units, e.g., 50k USD).

- Slab 1: 0 - 50,000 FCY
- Slab 2: 50,001 - 100,000 FCY
- Slab 3: 100,001 - 200,000 FCY (and above)

2. Product Rates
----------------
Each slab defines a specific markup percentage for different products:

| Product           | Slab 1 (0-50k) | Slab 2 (50-100k) | Slab 3 (100k+) |
|-------------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| Education TT      | 3.00%          | 1.25%            | 1.00%          |
| Maintaince TT     | 4.00%          | 1.50%            | 1.25%          |
| Gift TT           | 4.00%          | 1.50%            | 1.25%          |
| Currency Card     | 2.00%          | 1.25%            | 1.00%          |
| Currency Note     | 2.50%          | 1.50%            | 1.00%          |

3. Calculation Formula
----------------------
The final exchange rate is calculated as:

    Final Rate = IBR * (1 + (Markup% / 100))

Where:
- `IBR`: Inter-Bank Rate (Base market rate).
- `Markup%`: Retrieved from the table above based on the Product and Amount.

4. Implementation in Components
-------------------------------

A. Remittance (`Remittance.tsx`)
   - **Product Mapping**: 
     - "Education Abroad" -> `Education TT`
     - "Gift" -> `Gift TT`
     - All others (Family Maintenance, Travel, etc.) -> `Maintaince TT`
   - **Fee Removal**: The explicit "Service Fee" (previously 0.3%) has been removed (set to 0). The revenue is now entirely captured within the rate markup.

B. Forex Card (`ForexCardApply.tsx`)
   - **Product**: `Currency Card`
   - **Display**: Added a new section to display the "Slab-wise Exchange Rate" and "Total Payable".

C. Currency Exchange (`Step1OrderDetails.tsx`)
   - **Product**: `Currency Note`
   - **Logic**: Applies to "Buy Forex" transactions (Customer buying notes).
   - **Fee Removal**: Explicit service fee set to 0.

5. Example
----------
Scenario: Customer wants to send 10,000 USD for Education.
- IBR (Base Rate): 84.00
- Slab: 0 - 50,000 (Markup: 3.00%)
- Calculation: 84.00 * (1 + 0.03) = 84.00 * 1.03 = 86.52
- Final Rate: ₹86.52
